1. In your reddit_relative.py, what intermediate results did you .cache()? Briefly describe what would have happened if you hadn't used .cache() anywhere.

On line 43 the dataframe averagees was cached. If .cache() wasn't used anywhere then previously used variables would have to be recalculated unnecessarily, thus increasing the total runtime of the program.

How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the “best author” program above?

Without broadcast
1min20secs

With broadcast
1min18secs

While observing the running time from frontend YARN, it is unclear if the broadcast has affected the running time. It appears to resulted in a slightly improved running time. Perhaps, if we increase the dataset size there would be more of a noticeable difference.
